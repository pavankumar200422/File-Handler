# File-Handler
A file handler is a vital component of software systems, facilitating interaction between applications and files stored on a computer's file system. It manages operations such as reading, writing, creating, and deleting files. Through its interface, developers can seamlessly manipulate file data, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. With its pivotal role in file I/O operations, the file handler abstracts complexities, providing a streamlined experience for software development. Its functionalities are crucial across various domains, including text editing, database management, and web servers. In essence, the file handler acts as a bridge, enabling seamless communication between software applications and the underlying file system.
