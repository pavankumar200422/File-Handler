# File-Handler
A file handler is a vital component of software systems, facilitating interaction between applications and files stored on a computer's file system. It manages operations such as reading, writing, creating, and deleting files. Through its interface, developers can seamlessly manipulate file data, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. With its pivotal role in file I/O operations, the file handler abstracts complexities, providing a streamlined experience for software development. Its functionalities are crucial across various domains, including text editing, database management, and web servers. In essence, the file handler acts as a bridge, enabling seamless communication between software applications and the underlying file system.


Components of a file handler include:

1.File Operations Interface: This component provides methods or functions for performing various file operations such as opening, closing, reading, and writing files. It abstracts away the low-level details of file manipulation, allowing developers to interact with files using higher-level abstractions.

2.Error Handling Mechanism: A robust file handler includes mechanisms to handle errors that may occur during file operations, such as file not found, permission denied, or disk full errors. Proper error handling ensures that the application can gracefully recover from unexpected situations.

3.File System Interaction: The file handler interacts with the underlying file system of the operating system to perform file-related tasks. It translates high-level file operations into system calls or API calls understood by the file system, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.

4.Buffering and Caching: To improve performance, the file handler may incorporate buffering and caching mechanisms. Buffering involves temporarily storing data in memory before writing it to the file, reducing the number of disk accesses. Caching stores frequently accessed file data in memory to minimize disk reads, enhancing overall system performance.

5.Security and Permissions Management: File handlers often include features for managing file permissions and enforcing security policies. This may involve checking user permissions before allowing file operations and implementing encryption or access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data.

6.Concurrency and Synchronization: In multi-threaded or multi-process environments, the file handler must ensure proper concurrency control and synchronization to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies. This may involve implementing locks, mutexes, or other synchronization primitives to coordinate access to shared files.

7.Platform Independence: Ideally, the file handler should be designed to be platform-independent, allowing applications to seamlessly run on different operating systems without modification. This may require abstraction of platform-specific file system APIs and ensuring compatibility across platforms.

To run this code:

1)Move to code directory:  cd code

2)Compile :  to compile the '.cpp' files into object files
           g++ -c filehandlerapp.cpp -o filehandlerapp.o
           g++ -c filehandlerfuncion.cpp -o filehandlerfunction.o
           
3)Link: After compiling, to link the object files into an executable named filehandler
           g++ filehanlderapp.o filehandlerfunction.o -o filehandler
           
4)Run: ./filehandler
